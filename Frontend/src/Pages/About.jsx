              <p className="text-left">The idea behind Beacon Tutorials was to provide a guiding signal to students who aspire to pursue careers in science and engineering. The name "Beacon" symbolizes the institute's commitment to guiding students towards academic excellence and professional success.</p>
              <p className="text-left">The journey of Beacon Tutorials began with a group of passionate educators who came together to provide quality coaching and mentoring to students preparing for competitive exams like JEE Mains, NEET, and Board exams. They recognized the need for personalized attention and customized study plans to help students achieve their full potential.</p>
              <p className="text-left">With this vision in mind, Beacon Tutorials was established, starting from a small classroom with just a handful of students. The institute's founding team was committed to providing a nurturing & motivating learning environment that focused on each student's individual needs. As the institute's reputation grew, so did its infrastructure and faculty. Today, Beacon Tutorials has become a leading coaching institute, with a team of highly qualified and experienced teachers, state-of-the-art facilities, and a proven track record of success.</p>
